1. we need to set up put database on mongoDB website
2. we need to install mongoose : npm i mongoose             mongoose is a library, that makes working with mongo easily
    about mongoose: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html
    in this tutorial we will be working around connections 

3. in .env need to create connnection string : primer: DATABASE_URI=mongodb+srv://mongotut:krneki123@cluster0.hskekxl.mongodb.net/CompanyDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
                                                        DATABASE_URI=mongodb+srv://mongotut:"ourpassword"@cluster0.hskekxl.mongodb.net/ourDBname?retryWrites=true&w=majority


4. we need to require mongoose in server.js
5. in config folder we create new file - dbConn
6. we need to connect our app with mongoDB in dbConn : 
                const connectDB = async () => {
                try {
                    await mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URI, {
                    useUnifiedTopology: true,
                    useNewUrlParser: true,
                    });
                } catch (err) {
                    console.log(err);
                }
                };


7. we need to require connectDB in server.js and connect our server.js with DB : connectDB()
8. //We donst want to listen to events, if we are not connected to MongoDB, thats why we need
//to check first if we are connected to db. - on mongoose documentation, there are connection events, we want to listen for connection 
        mongoose.connection.once("open", ()=>{
        console.log("Connected to MondoDB")
        app.listen(PORT, () => {
            console.log(`Server runnin on post ${PORT}`);
        });
        })

9. Then we create Employee and user schema in model folder https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html and create and export associated models with our schemas
10. Then we need to implement user schema and model in register controller
